You'll have to use a 1.25 hole saw to ream out the through hole of the T, or the auger won't fit through it. Resizing the auger is a bad idea because then the holes won't line up with the servo gear horn.

Print the STL files included in this repository, I used food safe PETG, but you can probably get away with just about anything. STL files from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2387904 My thanks to rubatan for designing them!

The body of the box was cut out of 3mm baltic birch on a laser cutter. The Lightburn file includes all the parts you need, fit into 12x20 frames for ease of cutting. (TODO: add to repository)
